Numerical Methods for GaussianElim and LU Fac
#Description This program uses Gaussian Elimination and LU factorization to solve systems of equations. This program also solves Determinates and can find if a System is diagonally dominate or positive definite.

-Solves if a System is positive definite.

-Solves if a System is Diagonally dominate.

-Solves a System using Gaussian Elimination.

-Solves a System using LU Factorization

#Dependencies -This program uses no dependencies. -There are no dependencies

#How to Run the program -The bash script to run the program is python main.py

-All values have already been input into the program for the desired calucations, so no input is needed.

#Contributors -This program was written by Andrew Chambers

-The program does use a code derived from the equations in the posted slides of Dr Khanh Vu.

#License -The program is licensed under the MIT License
